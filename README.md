# ðŸ’» Simple ComPort Utility

This is a **free-to-use** serial port communication program designed for developers and engineers working with various serial communication standards.
  
  
## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?

I developed this utility to address specific control needs in the field while working with **RS232, TTL, and RS485** communications. Many existing tools felt overly complex or lacked the precise control required for real-world scenarios. My goal was to create something **simple, intuitive, and effective**.
     
    
## âœ¨ Key Features (Planned & Current)

Currently, the program focuses on providing **straightforward setup and essential functionalities** to get you up and running quickly.

Looking ahead, I plan to add several valuable features to enhance its capabilities:

* **Sent Data History**: Keep track of all the data you've transmitted.
* **HEX Data Functionality**: Improved handling and display for hexadecimal data.
* **Timed Data Transmission**: Automatically send data at specified intervals.
* **Customizable Hotkeys**: Assign shortcuts for frequently used actions.
* **TCP Server Integration**: Expand communication options beyond serial ports.
* **Update Checker**: 
* And more!
